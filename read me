# 🍽️ Healthy Eating Data Analysis

This project explores **how nutritional attributes and meal types influence the healthiness and ratings of meals** using **machine learning and data analytics**.  
It is based on the dataset `healthy_eating_dataset.csv` and demonstrates both **regression** and **classification** modeling.

---

## 🎯 Research Question

> **How do meal type, cuisine, and nutritional composition (calories, protein, carbs, fat, etc.) influence meal ratings and healthiness, and can we predict them using data analytics?**

---

## 📊 Objectives

1. Analyze how different nutritional and categorical factors affect meal ratings.  
2. Predict whether a meal is healthy or unhealthy using classification models.  
3. Identify which factors (e.g., calories, macros, cuisine type) most influence ratings and healthiness.  
4. Visualize key trends, correlations, and model insights.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Loaded and cleaned `healthy_eating_dataset.csv`
- Removed any URL/image-related columns
- Converted categorical variables (e.g., `meal_type`, `cuisine`)
- Engineered new features:
  - `cal_per_g` – energy density  
  - `protein_ratio`, `carb_ratio`, `fat_ratio` – macro composition ratios

### 2. **Exploratory Analysis**
- Correlation heatmap of numeric nutritional features  
- Visualization of relationships between nutritional metrics and target variables  

### 3. **Modeling**
#### 🔹 Regression Models (Predicting `rating`)
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  

#### 🔹 Classification Models (Predicting `is_healthy`)
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Gradient Boosting Classifier  

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Regression:** R², MAE, RMSE  
- **Classification:** Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC  

### 5. **Visualizations**
- Correlation Heatmap  
- Actual vs Predicted Rating Plot  
- Top Feature Importances  
- Confusion Matrix for Classification Models

## 📈 Findings

- **Nutritional balance** (especially higher protein and lower fat ratios) strongly correlates with both higher meal ratings and increased healthiness.  
- **Cooking method** and **meal type** also impact perceived quality and health level.  
- The **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** models performed best for both regression and classification tasks.  
- Machine learning can reliably predict healthiness and ratings based on nutritional attributes.

## 💡 Key Insights

| Aspect | Observation |
|--------|--------------|
| Highest Influence | Protein-to-fat ratio and calories per gram |
| Best Regression Model | Gradient Boosting Regressor (highest R², lowest RMSE) |
| Best Classification Model | Random Forest Classifier (highest F1 and Accuracy) |
| Visualization Highlights | Positive correlation between protein and rating; negative with sugar/fat |
